# UMD-Salary-Guide
Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization of UMD Salary Data 2013-2017


I want to extend a huge thank you to user achang96 and her group for sharing the data sets we used for this project!
You can find it at https://github.com/rosegaray/UMDSalaryGuideData 

If anyone from that group sees this, we tried to follow your methods in scraping the data sets, but faced several issues
that could mostly be attributed to inexperience. I hope you found the same irony I did in the Diamondback proclaiming transparency
but not responding to emails and doing everything in their power to make the Salary Guide unscrapeable. I contacted
Human Resources for the data set they provide the Diamondback, but got no response either.

I also want to say that any scrutiny of the coding of this project should be directed at me, and not the others
mentioned on the file. I'm still very new to coding and despite the other names on the project, I was the only contributor.
I am certain that the same things could have done much quicker without all those lines, 
and it doesn't help that none of the functions actually return anything, but you live and you learn!
If any of you folks listed on the project see this, I hold no animosity, and I was happy to get all the practice, even 
if it was painful at times. However, I strongly recommend you get your stuff together and find ways of making valid
contributions to future group projects. It is really not fair to yourself or those that did the work.

Things I learned in this project:
1) Lots of coding things
2) The data sets do not clarify things like hourly employees and bonuses
3) I need to get onboard with GitHub for future projects so it is easier to work together with team mates.
